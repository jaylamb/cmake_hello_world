This project was slapped together in a hurry to test Git and CMake. The source file and 
CMakeLists.txt should be enough to get everything going.

To run things:

1) Call "cmake ." from within the directory containing the hello_world.c and 
CMakeLists.txt files. 

2) Call "make"

3) Call ./hello

The end. How special.
